## Why do I use Git & GitHub?  

I use GitHub as the cloud-based host to upload and manage Git repositories I work on 

--

`r emo::ji("research")`  **Collaborative work**
    
  - Share, co-edit codes and files with other researchers.

<br>
--

`r fontawesome::fa("code")`  **Make records of code and data as I work on them**  

  - Tracks the changes to the code/project I have made.

`r fontawesome::fa("github")` **Track work on GitHub using Issues**

  - Plan our work,assign tasks and track progress via cross reference through pull requests or commits. 
    
  - Report bugs in code / suggest improvements. 
    
  - Share code outputs/ reproducible example code using **reprex R package** in GitHub issue conversations.
    
--

`r fontawesome::fa("code-branch")`  **Contribute to existing projects/ R package development** 

    
  - Clone/Fork repos to add my contribution in branches.
    
  - Create pull requests and assign reviewer

## How GitHub could help in your job search

**Having a GitHub profile with all your projects to showcase will help you! Recruiters could ask you to show them a piece of code you've written.**

- Start with a good bio & intro : a nice picture / something about what you do & like.

- You could set up a profile readme! Here's the [link](https://dev.to/github/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme-jha) to do that.

- Pin your most relevant projects & commits you are proud of. 

- Set up your projects with a good README and description with the project's purpose

- Invite others for collaboration.
